## External Learning Recommendations
As a user of the Defence DevSecOps Service (D2S), you will have access to support and guidance to ensure you have the right knowledge, skills and tools to make best use of the platform and services.

The ambition for D2S learning is to:
1. Support the MOD to build digital skills internally​
2. Provide prospective users with learning recommendations to support upskilling in DevSecOps​
3. Help and equip D2S service users to access, navigate and use the platform​

The ambition is to support the development of MOD capability internally by creating D2S modules for the JHub coding scheme, and establishing a mentoring and shadowing scheme between JHub coding scheme graduates and D2S service users.
