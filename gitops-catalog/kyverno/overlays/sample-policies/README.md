A set of sample policies taken from the Kyverno website and adjusted to run in auditing rather then enforcing mode. Please reference the [Kyverno Policy Library](https://kyverno.io/policies) if you are interested in using these in enforcing mode.

Once the policies are deployed along with Kyverno, you should see PolicyReport objects appearing in each namespace.
